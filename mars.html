            <h1>Mars</h1>
            <p>Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is often called the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance, which comes from iron oxide, or rust, on its surface. It has the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and a canyon, Valles Marineris, that dwarfs Earth's Grand Canyon. Mars has a thin atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, which cannot retain much heat, leading to temperatures that can vary widely between day and night. With surface conditions similar to Earth’s deserts, Mars is a focus of exploration for its potential to support human life and signs of past water flow.</p>
            <p>Mars has polar ice caps that expand and contract with the seasons, composed of water ice mixed with dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide). The planet’s thin atmosphere makes liquid water unstable on the surface, but evidence suggests it may have had rivers, lakes, and even oceans billions of years ago. Mars has two small, irregularly shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos, which may be captured asteroids. The planet also experiences dust storms that can engulf the entire planet for weeks. Recent missions have focused on finding microbial life or signs of past life and testing technologies for future human exploration.</p>
