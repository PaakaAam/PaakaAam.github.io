            <h1>Uranus</h1>
            <p>Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, is known for its unique tilt, which causes it to rotate on its side relative to its orbit. This unusual tilt gives Uranus extreme seasons, with each pole experiencing 42 years of sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness. It’s an ice giant, composed mainly of water, ammonia, and methane, which gives it a pale blue color. Uranus has a faint ring system and at least 27 known moons. Discovered in 1781 by William Herschel, it was the first planet found using a telescope, expanding our understanding of the solar system.</p>
            <p>Uranus’s unusual tilt, likely the result of a collision with a massive object early in its history, affects its seasons, with each pole experiencing 42 years of continuous sunlight or darkness. Its atmosphere contains traces of methane, which gives it a pale blue color. Uranus also has faint rings and a magnetic field offset from its rotational axis. It has at least 27 moons, named after characters from the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. Uranus's internal structure is believed to be composed of icy materials surrounding a rocky core, distinguishing it from the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn.</p>
