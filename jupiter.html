            <h1>Jupiter</h1>
            <p>Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun, is the largest in the solar system, with a diameter more than 11 times that of Earth. It’s a gas giant composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, with no solid surface. Its atmosphere features swirling clouds, with powerful storms like the Great Red Spot, a storm larger than Earth that has raged for at least 400 years. Jupiter has a strong magnetic field and at least 79 known moons, including Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system. Its immense gravity influences nearby planets and captures many asteroids, acting as a kind of shield for Earth.</p>
            <p>Jupiter's immense gravity affects the entire solar system, helping to clear its region of space from debris and potentially deflecting comets away from the inner planets. Beneath its colorful cloud layers, Jupiter's atmosphere transitions into a layer of liquid metallic hydrogen, where hydrogen molecules are compressed so densely that they behave like a metal, conducting electricity. Jupiter emits more heat than it receives from the Sun, likely due to slow contraction and residual heat from its formation. Among its diverse moons, Europa and Ganymede are of particular interest to scientists for their potential subsurface oceans, which could harbor life.</p>
