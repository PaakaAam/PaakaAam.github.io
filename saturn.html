            <h1>Saturn</h1>
            <p>Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is famous for its stunning ring system, which is made up of ice particles, rocky debris, and dust. Like Jupiter, Saturn is a gas giant composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. It has the second-largest planetary magnetic field and numerous moons, including Titan, which has its own thick atmosphere and surface lakes of liquid methane and ethane. Despite its size, Saturn is less dense than water and would float if there were an ocean large enough to hold it. Saturn’s rings and diverse moons make it one of the most intriguing objects in the solar system.</p>
            <p>Saturn’s rings, though striking, are relatively thin, spanning about 282,000 km (175,000 miles) in diameter but only 10 meters (30 feet) thick in places. The rings are divided into multiple sections, with some gaps created by small "shepherd moons" that shape the ring particles with their gravitational pull. Saturn has over 80 moons, with Enceladus and Titan drawing scientific interest due to their potential for hosting life. Enceladus has geysers that eject water vapor into space, while Titan has rivers, lakes, and seas of liquid hydrocarbons, as well as a dense atmosphere, making it one of the most Earth-like bodies.</p>
