            <h1>Venus</h1>
            <p>Venus, the second planet from the Sun, is often called Earth’s "sister planet" because of its similar size and composition. However, Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, trapping heat in a runaway greenhouse effect. This makes Venus the hottest planet, with surface temperatures around 475°C (900°F), hot enough to melt lead. The surface pressure is about 92 times that of Earth's, equivalent to being 900 meters underwater. Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets, with one day lasting 243 Earth days, making its rotation longer than its orbit around the Sun.</p>
            <p>Venus has a day-night cycle that lasts longer than its orbit around the Sun, taking about 117 Earth days from sunrise to sunrise due to its retrograde rotation. Surface winds are relatively slow, but higher in the atmosphere, winds can reach speeds of over 360 km/h (225 mph), creating a "super-rotation" effect that moves clouds around the planet in about four Earth days. Venus’s extreme greenhouse effect makes it hotter than Mercury, despite being farther from the Sun. Probes that have landed on Venus, like the Soviet Venera missions, survived only a few hours due to the high pressure and heat.</p>
